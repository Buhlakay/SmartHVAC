    <h2 id="intro"><u>Introduction</u></h2>
        <p>
            &emsp;In recent years many people are buying HVAC units to help with heating and cooling their home.
            With home automation becoming more and more popular and systems like the Nest gaining popularity,
            we thought that smart HVAC stystems were missing something. Much of the electrical bill for a 
            household comes from heating and cooling, a lot of times throughout the day when the owner isn't
            even home. Often times it can be difficult to remember to turn of your HVAC system or keep it on 
            a consistent schedule when people's schedule's are constantly changing.
            <br>
        </p>
    <h2 id="desc"><u>Project Description</u></h2>
        <p>
            &emsp;We wanted to help combat rising temperatures and electrical costs with our system. Our system 
            is a smart HVAC system that you will be able to sync to your own schedule 
            so that it will automatically heat and cool your home to the optimal temperature throughout 
            the day in depending on how the outside temperature changes throughout the day. Our system will 
            adapt to the temperature in order to heat and cool your home accordingly and save you money.
            <br><br>
            &emsp;However, if unforseen circumstances require you to defer from your normal schedule, the
            system will automatically change back to your own preferred temperature whenever it detects
            movement at home.
        </p>
    <h2 id="goals"><u>Goals</u></h2>
        <p>
            There were a few goals we knew we had to accomplish:
            <ul>
                <li>Develop smart HVAC system that will automatically adjust heating/air conditioning settings</li>
                <li>Make decisions based on outside temperature and presence</li>
                <li>Ensure that the system can be constantly running with little to no downtime</li>
                <li>Allow users to customize temperature settings to fit their personal needs</li>
                <li>Allow users to see that the system is working and what it has been doing over time</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    <h2 id="process"><u>Processes</u></h2>
        <h4>IBM Bluemix Cloud</h4>
            <p>
                &emsp;Used to run script that gets values from the raspberry pi. Creates and displays graph 
                that shows the temperature within the house throughout the day. Graph shows when the heating 
                or cooling has been turned on
            </p>
        <h4>Software Development</h4>
            <p>
                We made use of a few APIs to accomplish our goals:
                <ul>
                    <li>Dark Sky</li>
                    <li>Google Calendar</li>
                </ul>
                &emsp;We used Dark Sky for all of our weather data. We collect data from Dark Sky based on a set 
                zip code and then sample this throughout the day in order to change the temperature in the 
                household.<br>
                &emsp;We used Google Calendar to collect all of the schedule information. The user can upload their 
                daily schedule to Google Calendar and our system will know when the user will or won't be home 
                so that it can heat or cool the home in order to best match with the outside temperature.
            </p>
        <h4>Hardware Development</h4>
            <p> 
                &emsp;We used a Raspberry Pi for out main hardware controller. The Pi had a few functions for this 
                project. First it is a publisher for the MQTT broker and handles the motion sensor logic. 
                The Pi will run code to process the motion sensor values and then publish them to the MQTT 
                server to be read. We also decided to have the Pi retrieve and process the weather values from 
                the Dark Sky api.
