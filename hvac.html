    <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            &emsp;In recent years many people are buying HVAC units to help with heating and cooling their home.
            With home automation becoming more and more popular and systems like the Nest gaining popularity,
            we thought that smart HVAC stystems were missing something. Much of the electrical bill for a 
            household comes from heating and cooling, a lot of times throughout the day when the owner isn't
            even home. Often times it can be difficult to remember to turn of your HVAC system or keep it on 
            a consistent schedule when people's schedule's are constantly changing.

            &emsp;We wanted to help combat rising temperatures and electrical costs with our system. Our system,
            /INSERT NAME HERE/, is a smart HVAC system that you will be able to sync to your own schedule 
            so that it will automatically heat and cool your home to the optimal temperature throughout 
            the day in depending on how the outside temperature changes throughout the day. Our system will 
            adapt to the temperature in order to heat and cool your home accordingly and save you money.
            <br><br>
            &emsp;However, if unforseen circumstances require you to defer from your normal schedule, the
            system will automatically change back to your own preferred temperature whenever it detects
            movement at home.
